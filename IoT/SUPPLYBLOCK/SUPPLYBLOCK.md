# SUPPLYBLOCK: Blockchain-AI Hybrid for Supply Chain Audits  

**Revolutionizing supply chain integrity with on-device verification and decentralized trust**

## üìå Core Concept  
SUPPLYBLOCK creates a tamper-proof audit trail for physical goods by combining BeagleBone Black's real-time verification capabilities with blockchain immutability. Each BBB acts as a "trust node" attached to shipping containers, pallets, or sensitive packages, performing on-device AI verification of contents and environmental conditions before logging cryptographic proofs to a distributed ledger.

## üîç How It Works  

### üß† AI Verification Layer (On-Device)  
```python
# Simplified BBB inference workflow
from tflite_runtime.interpreter import Interpreter
import cv2

def verify_integrity(capture):
    # 1. Capture container seal/contents
    img = cv2.imdecode(capture, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)
    
    # 2. Run lightweight CNN model (TFLite)
    interpreter = Interpreter('tamper_detection.tflite')
    interpreter.allocate_tensors()
    
    # 3. Analyze for anomalies
    input_details = interpreter.get_input_details()
    interpreter.set_tensor(input_details[0]['index'], preprocess(img))
    interpreter.invoke()
    
    # 4. Output: 0=Valid, 1=Tampered, 2=Uncertain
    return interpreter.get_output_details()[0]['index']
```

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Components  

| Component               | Implementation Details                                  |

| **Hardware**            | BBB + Camera + Environmental Sensors (Temp/Humidity/Accel) |
| **AI Model**            | Quantized CNN (TensorFlow Lite) for tamper detection   |
| **Consensus**           | Proof-of-Elapsed-Time (PoET) for low-energy validation |
| **Data Storage**        | IPFS for encrypted media + Hyperledger Sawtooth        |
| **Security**            | TPM 2.0 hardware crypto + Zero-Knowledge Proofs        |
| **Inter-node Comms**    | LoRaWAN for remote, WiFi Direct for local clusters     |

## üåê Key Features  

- **Real-time Tamper Detection**  
  PRUs process camera feed at 30fps with <100ms anomaly detection latency  

- **Decentralized Auditing**  
  3-node consensus required before writing to chain  

- **Privacy-Preserving**  
  Homomorphic encryption allows computation on encrypted sensor data  

- **Offline-First Operation**  
  Stores verifications locally when out of network range  

- **Auto-Forensics**  
  Triggers high-res capture + GPS logging on tamper detection  

## üí° Why BeagleBone Black?  

1. **PRUs** enable real-time sensor monitoring while main CPU handles AI  
2. **Built-in Crypto Hardware** (TI Sitara AM335x) for secure key storage  
3. **Low Power Operation** (<2W) suitable for battery-powered shipments  
4. **Cape Ecosystem** for industrial sensor integration  
5. **True Dual-Core** processing for parallel AI/blockchain workloads
