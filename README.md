### IDEAS
- âœ¨ I'm a solo-developer with a ton of interesting ideas. Most of the joy of development comes from the ideation itself for me. Most of these projects I simply just do not have the time nor resources to entirely develop myself. Rather than them waste away, I figured I'd collect them all in this repo - perhaps some may spark interest in others âœ¨

- If anyone finds a particular project of interest, please contact me at calebjdt@gmail.com - we can hopefully discuss how we might actually bring any of them to life ðŸ¤“
